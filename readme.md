# Bootstrap
This is a first use of some bootstrap components. Specifically navigation bar, jambotron, carousel, forms, modals, alerts, and cards.
## Experience
It was a handful but I learn as I type so all good.

## Problems
At first I had a hard time placing the components at the center. I fixed it by using the grid layout and placed the component on the center column.

## Todos
I will definitely continue on discovering other bootstrap components.
